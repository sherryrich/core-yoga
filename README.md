## Technologies Used

I intentionally did not use Boostrap on this project as I wanted to learn and master HTML & CSS without reliance on this CSS framework.

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Google Chrome Dev tools for debugging
* Google Light house for audits


## Testing

* Rigerous testing was completed via Google Chrome Dev tools. Responsive design from a mobile first strategy. Most notably iPhone SE (375 x 667) and larger screen sizes.
